Database created for Digital Image Processing classes at UTFPR-Toledo, as part of an assignment on fruit classification, on March of 2024.
Most fruits can easily be found in local supermarkets on the southern regions of Brazil. Some of them (namely Araticum and Butia) are native fruits found in wild and rural belts in these regions.

There are 10 fruit classes, each class in its own directory:
0: Apple
1: Araticum
2: Avocado
3: Banana
4: Butia
5: Khaki
6: Mango
7: Orange
8: Star fruit
9: Ugli fruit

For each class, 5 specimen were chosen. 2 photos were taken on a white background (V1-W and V2-W) and another 2 on a black background (V1-B and V2-B) for each specimen.

The images were named as follows:

<class_id>-<specimen_id>-V<version_number>-<background>

E.g: 4-05-V2-B is a butia, specimen number 5, second photo taken on a black background.
